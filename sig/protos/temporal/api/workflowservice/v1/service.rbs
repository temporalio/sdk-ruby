        # WorkflowService API defines how Temporal SDKs and other clients interact with the Temporal server
        #  to create and interact with workflows and activities.
        #
        #  Users are expected to call `StartWorkflowExecution` to create a new workflow execution.
        #
        #  To drive workflows, a worker using a Temporal SDK must exist which regularly polls for workflow
        #  and activity tasks from the service. For each workflow task, the sdk must process the
        #  (incremental or complete) event history and respond back with any newly generated commands.
        #
        #  For each activity task, the worker is expected to execute the user's code which implements that
        #  activity, responding with completion or failure.
