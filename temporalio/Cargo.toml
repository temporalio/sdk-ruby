# Ruby and rb-sys seem to require a Cargo.toml here at the gem root (see https://github.com/oxidize-rb/rb-sys/issues/405),
# and Rust is broken if one workspace is nested within another without the ability to exclude (see
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6745). So we basically must copy sdk-core's workspace for now.
# TODO(cretz): Fix this situation if possible without moving sdk-core submodule.
