  module Activity
    # Base class for all activities.
    #
    # Activities can be given to a worker as instances of this class, which will call execute on the same instance for
    # each execution, or given to the worker as the class itself which instantiates the activity for each execution.
    #
    # All activities must implement {execute}. Inside execute, {Activity::Context.current} can be used to access the
    # current context to get information, issue heartbeats, etc.
    #
    # By default, the activity is named as its unqualified class name. This can be customized with {activity_name}.
    #
    # By default, the activity uses the `:default` executor which is usually the thread-pool based executor. This can be
    # customized with {activity_executor}.
    #
    # By default, upon cancellation {::Thread.raise} or {::Fiber.raise} is called with a {Error::CanceledError}. This
    # can be disabled by passing `false` to {activity_cancel_raise}.
    #
    # See documentation for more detail on activities.
