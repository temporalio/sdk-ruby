  # Client for accessing Temporal.
  #
  # Most users will use {connect} to connect a client. The {workflow_service} method provides access to a raw gRPC
  # client. To create another client on the same connection, like for a different namespace, {options} may be used to
  # get the options as a struct which can then be dup'd, altered, and splatted as kwargs to the constructor (e.g.
  # +Client.new(**my_options.to_h)+).
  #
  # Clients are thread-safe and are meant to be reused for the life of the application. They are built to work in both
  # synchronous and asynchronous contexts. Internally they use callbacks based on {::Queue} which means they are
  # Fiber-compatible.

    # @param target_host [String] +host:port+ for the Temporal server. For local development, this is often
    #   +localhost:7233+.
    # @param namespace [String] Namespace to use for client calls.
    # @param api_key [String, nil] API key for Temporal. This becomes the +Authorization+ HTTP header with +"Bearer "+
    #   prepended. This is only set if RPC metadata doesn't already have an +authorization+ key.
    # @param tls [Boolean, Connection::TLSOptions] If false, do not use TLS. If true, use system default TLS options. If
    #   TLS options are present, those TLS options will be used.

    #   worker.

    #   with warn level. Callers setting this logger are responsible for closing it.

    #   condition for workflow queries if not set during query. See {WorkflowHandle.query} for details on the
    #   rejection condition.

    #   by per-call RPC metadata keys.

    #   high-level calls made by this client (which all opt-in to retries by default).

    #   is created with it. Lazy clients cannot be used for workers if they have not performed a connection.
