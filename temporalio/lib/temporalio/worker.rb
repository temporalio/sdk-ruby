    # @param activities [Array<Activity::Definition, Class<Activity::Definition>, Activity::Definition::Info>]
    #   Activities for this worker.
    # @param workflows [Array<Class<Workflow::Definition>>] Workflows for this worker.
    # @param tuner [Tuner] Tuner that controls the amount of concurrent activities/workflows that run at a time.
    # @param activity_executors [Hash<Symbol, Worker::ActivityExecutor>] Executors that activities can run within.
    # @param workflow_executor [WorkflowExecutor] Workflow executor that workflow tasks run within. This must be a
    #   {WorkflowExecutor::ThreadPool} currently.
    # @param interceptors [Array<Interceptor::Activity, Interceptor::Workflow>] Interceptors specific to this worker.
    #   Note, interceptors set on the client that include the {Interceptor::Activity} or {Interceptor::Workflow} module
    #   are automatically included here, so no need to specify them again.
    # @param build_id [String] Unique identifier for the current runtime. This is best set as a unique value
    #   representing all code and should change only when code does. This can be something like a git commit hash. If
    #   unset, default is hash of known Ruby code.
    # @param identity [String, nil] Override the identity for this worker. If unset, client identity is used.
    # @param logger [Logger] Logger to override client logger with. Default is the client logger.
    # @param max_cached_workflows [Integer] Number of workflows held in cache for use by sticky task queue. If set to 0,
    #   workflow caching and sticky queuing are disabled.
    # @param max_concurrent_workflow_task_polls [Integer] Maximum number of concurrent poll workflow task requests we
    #   will perform at a time on this worker's task queue.
    # @param nonsticky_to_sticky_poll_ratio [Float] `max_concurrent_workflow_task_polls` * this number = the number of
    #   max pollers that will be allowed for the nonsticky queue when sticky tasks are enabled. If both defaults are
    #   used, the sticky queue will allow 4 max pollers while the nonsticky queue will allow one. The minimum for either
    #   poller is 1, so if `max_concurrent_workflow_task_polls` is 1 and sticky queues are enabled, there will be 2
    #   concurrent polls.
    # @param max_concurrent_activity_task_polls [Integer] Maximum number of concurrent poll activity task requests we
    #   will perform at a time on this worker's task queue.
    # @param no_remote_activities [Boolean] If true, this worker will only handle workflow tasks and local activities,
    #   it will not poll for activity tasks.
    # @param sticky_queue_schedule_to_start_timeout [Float] How long a workflow task is allowed to sit on the sticky
    #   queue before it is timed out and moved to the non-sticky queue where it may be picked up by any worker.
    # @param max_heartbeat_throttle_interval [Float] Longest interval for throttling activity heartbeats.
    # @param default_heartbeat_throttle_interval [Float] Default interval for throttling activity heartbeats in case
    #   per-activity heartbeat timeout is unset. Otherwise, it's the per-activity heartbeat timeout * 0.8.
    # @param max_activities_per_second [Float, nil] Limits the number of activities per second that this worker will
    #   process. The worker will not poll for new activities if by doing so it might receive and execute an activity
    #   which would cause it to exceed this limit.
    # @param max_task_queue_activities_per_second [Float, nil] Sets the maximum number of activities per second the task
    #   queue will dispatch, controlled server-side. Note that this only takes effect upon an activity poll request. If
    #   multiple workers on the same queue have different values set, they will thrash with the last poller winning.
    # @param graceful_shutdown_period [Float] Amount of time after shutdown is called that activities are given to
    #   complete before their tasks are canceled.
    # @param use_worker_versioning [Boolean] If true, the `build_id` argument must be specified, and this worker opts
    #   into the worker versioning feature. This ensures it only receives workflow tasks for workflows which it claims
    #   to be compatible with. For more information, see https://docs.temporal.io/workers#worker-versioning.
    # @param disable_eager_activity_execution [Boolean] If true, disables eager activity execution. Eager activity
    #   execution is an optimization on some servers that sends activities back to the same worker as the calling
    #   workflow if they can run there. This should be set to true for `max_task_queue_activities_per_second` to work
    #   and in a future version of this API may be implied as such (i.e. this setting will be ignored if that setting is
    #   set).
    # @param illegal_workflow_calls [Hash<String, [:all, Array<Symbol>]>] Set of illegal workflow calls that are
    #   considered unsafe/non-deterministic and will raise if seen. The key of the hash is the fully qualified string
    #   class name (no leading `::`). The value is either `:all` which means any use of the class, or an array of
    #   symbols for methods on the class that cannot be used. The methods refer to either instance or class methods,
    #   there is no way to differentiate at this time.
    # @param workflow_failure_exception_types [Array<Class<Exception>>] Workflow failure exception types. This is the
    #   set of exception types that, if a workflow-thrown exception extends, will cause the workflow/update to fail
    #   instead of suspending the workflow via task failure. These are applied in addition to the
    #   `workflow_failure_exception_type` on the workflow definition class itself. If {::Exception} is set, it
    #   effectively will fail a workflow/update in all user exception cases.
    # @param workflow_payload_codec_thread_pool [ThreadPool, nil] Thread pool to run payload codec encode/decode within.
    #   This is required if a payload codec exists and the worker is not fiber based. Codecs can potentially block
    #   execution which is why they need to be run in the background.
    # @param debug_mode [Boolean] If true, deadlock detection is disabled. Deadlock detection will fail workflow tasks
    #   if they block the thread for too long. This defaults to true if the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable is
    #   `true` or `1`.
