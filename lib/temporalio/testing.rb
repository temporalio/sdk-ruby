      # This environment is good for testing full server capabilities, but does not support time
      # skipping like {.start_time_skipping} does.
      # {Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment#supports_time_skipping} will always return `false`
      # for this environment. {Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment#sleep} will sleep the actual
      # amount of time and {Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment#get_current_time}` will return
      # the current time.
      #
      # Internally, this uses [Temporalite](https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite). Which is a
      # self-contained binary for Temporal using Sqlite persistence. This will download Temporalite
      # to a temporary directory by default if it has not already been downloaded before and
      # `:existing_path` is not set.
      #
      # In the future, the Temporalite implementation may be changed to another implementation.
      # Therefore, all `temporalite_` prefixed parameters are Temporalite specific and may not apply
      # to newer versions.

      #   unset, this is the system's temporary directory.
      # @param ui [Boolean] If `true`, will start a UI in Temporalite.
      # @param temporalite_existing_path [String] Existing path to the Temporalite binary. If
      #   present, no download will be attempted to fetch the binary.
      # @param temporalite_database_filename [String] Path to the Sqlite database to use for
      #   Temporalite. Unset default means only in-memory Sqlite will be used.
      # @param temporalite_log_format [String] Log format for Temporalite.
      # @param temporalite_log_level [String] Log level to use for Temporalite.
