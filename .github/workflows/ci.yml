        # TODO(cretz): Enable Linux ARM. It's not natively supported with setup-ruby (see
        # https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby#supported-platforms and https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/577).
        # So we need to set ruby-version to 'none' per
        # https://github.com/oxidize-rb/actions/tree/main/setup-ruby-and-rust and install Ruby ourselves maybe. See
        # https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby?tab=readme-ov-file#using-self-hosted-runners. The error states:
        #     Error: The current runner (ubuntu-24.04-arm64) was detected as self-hosted because the platform does not match a GitHub-hosted runner image (or that image is deprecated and no longer supported).
        #     In such a case, you should install Ruby in the $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE yourself, for example using https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build
        #     You can take inspiration from this workflow for more details: https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml
